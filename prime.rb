  #what defines a prime number?
  #A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.
  #how to create a range of numbers?
  #how to turn a range into an array so it can be iterated over?
  #don't use any other Ruby library
  #must build a method that can verify whether a number is prime
  #don't require 'math' 
  #look into benchmarking
  # returns true for prime numbers (FAILED - 1)
  # returns false for non-prime numbers (FAILED - 2)
